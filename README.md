# The Mozart Musical Dice Game
## A recreation of Mozart's classic game of dice and music

This game is being created as an educational tool to show the different ways music can be pieced together. So far, it's still in its
infancy but can be played in your web browser [here.](https://kenny-designs.github.io/mozartDiceGame/dist/)

### Future milestones include:
* Full mobile support
* Several instruments to play with
* A slick and approachable UI
* Ability to export your songs

## Editing the Code
If you wish to make changes to the code, you'll need to have several things first. In particular, you will need npm. I recommend
downloading [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for it comes prepackaged with it.

I also make use of [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) for building the program. You will need to install it with npm along with any other
dependencies you may be prompted to install.

To build with Gulp, be sure to run 'gulp' on the command line where the 'gulpfile.js' is located. From there, open the index.html file in
the dist folder. If you have any questions please be sure to contact me and I'll help the best I can.
