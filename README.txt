Welcome to the Mozart Musical Dice Game!

As of now, opening the index.html file located in the dist then js directories
will allow you to try the program.

If you wish to make changes to the code, be sure to run 'gulp' in the command
line where the 'gulpfile.js' is located. From there, open the index.html file in
the same dist then js directories as before.

I can be contacted at alexanderman2004@yahoo.com. Please be sure to reference
the game in the title when sending emails.

Thank you and I hope you enjoy! The project still has tons of ground to traverse
but in due time it shall be making leaps and bounds! See you then!
